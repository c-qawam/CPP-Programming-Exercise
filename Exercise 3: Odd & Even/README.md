## Exercise Description

Write two functions, *isOdd()* and *isEven()*, with a single numeric parameter named
*number*. The *isOdd()* function returns *True* if *number* is *odd* and *False* if *number* is even. The
*isEven()* function returns the *True* if *number* is *even* and *False* if *number* is *odd*. Both
functions return *False* for numbers with fractional parts, such as *3.14* or *-4.5*. *Zero* is considered
an even number.

conditions are all ``True``:
